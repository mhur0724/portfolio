  <p>
This is my fully responsive portfolio website made using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It is meant to display the projects I've worked on, as well as some more information about who I am. 

I think the coolest feature is the ability to toggle from a Lakers to Dodgers theme but an honorable mention is the little easter egg I've hidden in the projects section!

In the future I do want to clean up the code a bit more, especially for the theme toggle section. I think React's abiltiy to conditionally render styling would help a lot with this.
